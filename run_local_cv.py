# Run this file on CV2 in local machine to construct a Concentration Index (CI).
# Video image will show emotion on first line, and engagement on second. Engagement/concentration classification displays either 'Pay attention', 'You are engaged' and 'you are highly engaged' based on CI. Webcam is required.
# Analysis is in 'Util' folder.
